INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT

The word “online job portal” is such a common word, which needs no definition. This word itself defines its meaning which is to provide portal to employer and employee for job.
Now in this changing world the necessity of job has increased out of proportion. In pre-industrial era, mankind were used to search for jobs offline, as for example they used to go for any vacancy notice through walkin. Today we have many other methods and options to find jobs, as for example we have newspaper, online job portals.
Online job portal is a web application built in java. It provides the candidates ability toregister to this application and search for jobs, manage their accounts. Each candidatewill have their own account with their own home page.
On the other hand companies that are willing to publish the jobs for their company tocandidates can register to the job portal and get their own account created and can post jobs to portal‘s database .
Registered companies can add or remove jobs and these jobs can be seen by variouscandidates and they can contact the company person for the job. Main aim of thisweb application is to make a good web application that can make this job searchoption easy and accessible to everyone who are interested.
It provides the Recruitment of people with all the necessary tools to schedulethe interview and applicants to register and apply for jobs and interviewers to view theinterview details. It provides the users with all the necessary privileges to access andmodify the data intended for them.
Our this system which is named as “online job portal” actually deals with this problem of announcement of vacancies for employer and getting info of announced vacancy for jobseeker.
To implement this working system, I have developed a web based project. The World Wide Web and the internet that empowers it are the most important developments in the history of computing. These technologies have drawn us all into the information age. With the help of web we can share information from any one who presents at large distance from us.
